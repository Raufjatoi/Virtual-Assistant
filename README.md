# Simple Virtual Assistant
This is a simple virtual assistant (VA) that is still in development. I am using the Groq and LLaMA-3.1-8B-instant model as the LLM. For the user interface, I used Streamlit, and for audio preprocessing and speech-to-text functionality, I utilized libraries like `speech_recognition` and `pyttsx3` mentioned in the `requirements.txt`.
