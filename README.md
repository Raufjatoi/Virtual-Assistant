# Simple Virtual Assistant
This is a simple virtual assistant (VA) that is still in development. I am currently working on using the GROQ and LLaMA-3.1-8B-instant model. For the user interface, I utilized Streamlit, and for audio preprocessing and speech-to-text functionality, I employed various libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt.

[!INF] You can change the system prompt based on the agent you need.

[WARNING] It is still under development, so it is not perfect.
